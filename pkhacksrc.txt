PK Hack .2 source code
by spaanoft (spaanoft@starmen.net) and Tomato (tomato@starmen.net)
http://www.starmen.net/pkhack

After 9 months or so we're finally releasing the source code. We planned to do it earlier
but:

 - we got lazy
 - we forgot
 - we got too busy in real life
 - Nintendo wanted to buy the source (okay, not really)

spaanoft got this to compile with Borland C++. Tomato tried (although not very hard) to
get it to compile with MS Visual C++ but didn't get it to work.

The Windows code was written by spaanoft, using C, none of that goofy MFC stuff. He had
no visual editors or anything which made things tougher, especially since Tomato wanted
some cool looking stuff.

Tomato wrote all the ROM editing code, which was written in C++. He tested it and wrote it
for the DJGPP compiler which is free (http://www.delorie.com).

It's highly doubtful anybody will use this source code for anything, but we're releasing it
for those curious people. And who knows, maybe somebody out there will make a better
EarthBound ROM editor using this source code for a basis. You can find pretty much all
the program code (Windows GUI and ROM hacking) in Project2.cpp.

If you're interested, we're also releasing a zip file containing a boatload of source code
that Tomato wrote. A lot of this code was used in PK Hack but a lot never was included
due to the reasons listed above. If you're a programmer you can use this code for EB
ROM hacking projects. You can find it in the download section of the PK Hack site, URL
listed above.

It's highly doubtful we'll ever work on new versions of PK Hack. So if you want the EB
ROM hacking "community" (it's not THAT big but it's got a following) to stay around, try
making your own hacking progs!

Okay, adios!

P.S. As you can see Joe the Talking Toilet was going to be included! But spaanoft didn't
     want him in :(
